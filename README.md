# Thirsty Dead
 
 A dating sim game that takes dating the undead in a unique manner.
 
 Being the only human in the world, in order to find the love of your life you go to a bar and encounter some female zombies. You approach them and strike a conversation hoping it leads somewhere. It leads to one of the biggest mechanics in our game which is card matching. If you choose a weapon card you lose your life until you have lost all your lives and the female zombie you date just eats the last remaining human.
 
 Try your best to survive and score them all!
